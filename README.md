#Code should run with no errors and display summary tables.
#PyCity Schools Analysis
#The code analyzes school data to identify trends in student performance based on factors like school spending, size, and type.
#The analysis summerizes the information into the following list:
#A District Summary with total schools, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing.
#Another summary table with the same information as 'District' but this time focused on the school type.
#A table with the highest performing schools (% Overall Passing) and another one with the lowest ones.
#A table by grades for math scores, and reading scores.
#And three tables of scores; one for size, another for spending and another for type pf school.
#In conclusion we can sumarrize two things:
#Conclusion number one is that 'Charter Schools' had higher passing students with a 90%; while 'District Schools' had a passing student percentage of 53%.
#Conclusion number two is that Reading scores had a higher percentage score with 80-85%; while math scores had a 77-83%.
